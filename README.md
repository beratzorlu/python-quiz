## The Story

The concept of this application regards a traditional quiz game. System Junk is based on a fictional dystopian narrative created specifically for this project. In the year 2555, the player is presented with a story world where world societies have abandoned all pursuits outside of science. This was a direct result of the expiry of various natural resources, forcing humankind to seek refuge in the benefits found through progressing scientific knowledge. While this approach allowed humanity to survive, cultures changed their fundamental approach to arts and humanities where they only view it as redundant practices. Earth's nations are far away from their state 500 years ago, and most are only mere communities. Because of this, people still depend on science to find solutions to solve their biggest problems, and they expect all individuals to invest all their time in this area.

More established societies have institutionalized this approach where every citizen is periodically tested on their knowledge of the fundamentals of science. Those who succeed in these assessments are granted further freedoms and living standards. Those who fail these tests, however, are removed from the mainstream margins of society and discarded to the outskirts of civilization with little to no rights to protect their humanity. Mainstream societies view these groups as unworthy of the full care of their governments, and label them as "System Junk." These outcast communities have since developed into organized societies that aim to take back their fundamental rights. The fate of the world is unknown, but with the emerging activity in outcast communities and the existance of an unyielding opression from mainstream socities, it is only plausible to expect nothing but a worldwide uprise brewing in the future to come.

## Technical Design

### Flowchart
![Flowchart](docs/flowchart.png)

### Data Model

The data model of this application consists of compartmentalized code that is imported across different .py files to better manage the various functions in a manageable manner. The class structure present in the colours.py allows access to various colours with shortcuts that are specific to each colour. This way the predetermined elements in the Colorama library are shortened and made easy to access regarding the needs of this application.

As regards the quiz questions, a separate questions.py file is created to house all questions and choices of content to be used in the game. The logic of the code loops through both the QUIZ_QUESTIONS library and QUIZ_CHOICES list and prints these as a pair to the terminal. The correct answer is determined by comparing the question and answer key/value pair in the QUIZ_QUESTIONS list with the user input. Removing this section of the code from the run.py helped better manage the development process without making the code contained in the run.py file too crowded.

The database model of this project is arguably simple as the application itself did not require complex manipulation of user data. That being said, targeting specific and relevant data that the collection of which would add meaningful value to the application was a key consideration for the data model design. Thus, 3 data points, namely; 
    
    - username,
    - final score,
    - final score percentage

were identified as relevant to the goals of this project. This process is achieved by utilizing the combined functionality available in Google Drive API and Google Spreadheets API, where the application communicates with these services to upload relevant data to a target spreadsheet. Please find below a screenshot of the relevant Google Spreadsheet.

### Colour Palette


[Coolors](https://coolors.co/) was a highly beneficial resource in this regard which provided significant help in identifying
matching colours that also have appropriate contrast.

![Colour Palette](docs/colour-palette.png)

---

## Website Features

The design considerations that impacted the envisioned features were mainly structured around CLI-based considerations. While there were more features planned in the initial stages of the project, some were not entertained to the benefit of serving the needs referenced in the [User Stories](#user-stories) section. Thus, it was important to focus on a minimum viable project rather than prioritizing the implementation of further features for the sake of it. This would only bloat the application without adding much real value to the user experience overall.

### Application Elements

The below elements are available to be experienced by the user across the quiz game application as a whole.

#### Welcome Logo

    There are many examples of the system feedback feature available throughout various sections 
    implemented in the application. As every instance of this feature serve the same purpose, 
    only one example is provided in the documentation to prevent repetition.

#### Player Performance

## Future Features

#### Leaderboard

- It is currently not possible to display a history of player data and compare the information in the database to structure a ranking system. However, the data already available in the Google Spreadsheets tied to the program is sufficient to implement this functionality. The development process for this project prioritized the completion of a minimum valuable product, thus removing a leaderboard feature from consideration. The future implementation of functionality like this would adequately expand upon its capacity to display information to the player.

## Validation

### PYTHON

Code Institute's [Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) was the main resouce during the code validation process. The relevant code passes with overall success with occassional minor warnings.

<details><summary>PEP8 Validation: run.py</summary>
<img src="docs/testing/run-py.png">
<ul><li>The errors detected for this file come from the ASCII art implemented to display the logo of the game. While these warnings can be avoided by removing the logo art, this would take away from the identity of the game. There is also an instance of indenting code for visual purposes which helped keep the lines 100-101 from being too long.</li></ul>
