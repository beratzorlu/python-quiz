### Colour Palette


[Coolors](https://coolors.co/) was a highly beneficial resource in this regard which provided significant help in identifying
matching colours that also have appropriate contrast.

## Website Features

The design considerations that impacted the envisioned features were mainly structured around conventional website design. While there were more features planned in the initial stages of the project, some were not entertained to the benefit of serving the needs referenced in the [User Stories](#user-stories) section. Thus, it was important to focus on a minimum viable project rather than prioritizing the implementation of further features for the sake of it. This would only bloat the website without adding much value to the user experience overall.

### Shared Elements

The below elements are available to be experienced by the user across the website as a whole.
